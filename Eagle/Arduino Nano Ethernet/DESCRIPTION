<b>Arduino Nano Based Ethernet Button Panel</b><br><br>
The project is composed of 2 custom boards and an arduino nano
(may be a custom version that does not have a USB port(undecided)).<br><br>

Board 1 is the user interface which contains 8 RGB surface mount LEDs and 8 conductive pads for switches. It also contains the input multiplier
(wire/I2C) and shift registers (SPI) that drive the LEDS and buttons.
It communicates with the other board via an 8 pin header and ribbon cable.<br><br>

Board 2 is a customized version of the Arduino Ethernet Shield that does not have an SD card slot. It also has a Power Over Ethernet (POE) module. This board has a socket for the arduino nano to mount in, as well as a matching header to connect board 1. It distributes the power from the POE module to the devices that require it. This is the only board that would techically qualify as a shield or daughterboard.<br><br>
